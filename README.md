### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hey there! I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the Faculty of Sciences, Novi Sad. Currently, I'm diving deep into a student research project focusing on RISC-V architecture, specifically optimizing video decoding. My passion extends to working on Machine Learning projects during my spare time, and I aspire to delve deeper into ML in my future education.

Alongside my primary research, I'm actively studying Java informational systems, and proficient in Python, C, as well as assembly languages for both RISC-V and ARM architectures. Always up for trying out new technologies and experiences, so feel free to reach out!
